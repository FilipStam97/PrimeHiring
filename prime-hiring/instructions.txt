Firstly go to the root folder of the project (prime-hiring)

Then open it in Visual Studio Code and open a terminal

Split the terminal in two instances (one is for the json server and other is for the application)

In the first terminal run the command "npm install", wait untill the setup finishes.

After that is complete , in the second terminal run the command "npm run serve" (for this and previous step to work both terminals should be on prime-hiring folder path)

Return to the first terminal and run the command "npm run start" , wait untill the application is served.

Then enjoy :)
